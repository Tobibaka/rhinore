Rhinore is an advanced underground safety and monitoring system designed to enhance mining operations through smart automation and real-time analytics. It integrates IoT sensors to track parameters like stress, displacement, vibration, and pore pressure across tunnels and zones, ensuring early detection of potential hazards. Overmen on-site receive instant alerts via a connected dashboard, while Control Heads in the central room can monitor sensor data, analyze patterns, and take preventive actions. By combining intelligent sensing, live data visualization, and multi-level access control, Rhinore ensures safer, more efficient, and data-driven mining environments.
